# Titanium Plates Theme 2020
This is a modified version of the Titanium Plates Theme for Racing League Tools for F1 2020.

I modified the original theme for my F1 2020 driver career but if you want to use it go ahead.

**__I do not own any of the original assets or code of this theme. All credit goes to Caccia and kaaac for creating and developing the original theme: https://github.com/kaaac/Titanium-Plates-Theme/__**

## What's changed?
As the original theme was made for the F1 22 game it doesn't represent the 2020 season, so I thought I should do something about it.
Here's what I changed:
- A 2020 background
- 2020 Driver photos
- 2020 Plate team colors (Every team will have their plate color be their 2020 color. For example, Red Bull has a darker blue, AlphaTauri are more grey...)
- 2020 Cars (The cars that appear on the plates)
- 2020 Lineup cards
- And probably other minor things I forgot to mention

## Examples:

## Installation
I'm no programmer or anything like this so everything might not work like it does on my machine, but I don't think you need to do anything other than to extract the downloaded ZIP file, drag the extracted folder to `.../user/mods/` and select the 2020 theme inside RLT.
